> - WOPI protocol operation tests (CheckFileInfo, Lock/Unlock, GetFile/PutFile)
> - Playwright document editing tests (open, edit, save, close)
> - Edge case tests (empty files, large files, concurrent access)
>
> **Estimated Effort**: Large
> **Parallel Execution**: YES - 4 waves
> **Critical Path**: T1-T3 (Security) → T4-T6 (WOPI) → T7-T9 (Playwright) → T10-T11 (Edge Cases)

## Context

### Original Request
"Plan more test scenarios for the Word-Office testsuite" with priority on security validation.

### Interview Summary
**Key Discussions**:
- **Test Coverage**: Full WOPI protocol + Document editing + Security + edge cases
- **Testing Tool**: Playwright for browser-based document operations
- **Priority**: Security validation first
- **Test Approach**: Real Document Server (not mocked)

**Current Test Coverage**:
- Health checks: DS, OCIS, Companion, Stack (4 test files)
- WOPI discovery: XML validation
- API endpoints: /api/health, /api/config, /api/health/wopi

**Research Findings**:
- WOPI protocol has defined operations: CheckFileInfo, Lock/Unlock, GetFile/PutFile
- JWT validation is critical for OCIS ↔ DS communication
- Playwright is recommended for document editing tests (browser-based)
- Edge cases include: empty files, large files, concurrent access, network failures

---

## Work Objectives

### Core Objective
Extend the testsuite with comprehensive test coverage for security, WOPI protocol operations, document editing, and edge cases.

### Concrete Deliverables
- `tests/e2e/security/*.test.js` - Security validation tests
- `tests/e2e/wopi/operations.test.js` - WOPI protocol operations
- `tests/e2e/documents/*.test.js` - Playwright document editing tests
- `tests/e2e/edge/*.test.js` - Edge case handling tests
- Playwright configuration for browser-based testing

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All security tests pass (JWT, input validation, XSS/CSRF)
- [ ] WOPI protocol operations validated
- [ ] Document editing works end-to-end via Playwright
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully

### Must Have
- JWT token validation tests (invalid, expired, malformed)
- Input validation on all endpoints
- WOPI CheckFileInfo, Lock/Unlock, GetFile/PutFile tests
- Playwright document open/edit/save/close tests

### Must NOT Have (Guardrails)
- NO performance/load tests
- NO accessibility tests
- NO tests that require manual intervention
- NO mocked WOPI responses (use real DS)

---

## Verification Strategy

> **ZERO HUMAN INTERVENTION** - ALL verification is agent-executed.

### Test Decision
- **Infrastructure exists**: YES (Jest + Playwright to be added)
- **Automated tests**: YES (TDD approach)
- **Framework**: Jest + Playwright

### QA Policy
Every task MUST include agent-executed QA scenarios.

## Final Verification Wave

- [ ] F1. Plan Compliance Audit — `oracle`
  Read the plan end-to-end. For each "Must Have": verify test exists. For each "Must NOT Have": search for forbidden patterns. Check evidence files exist. Compare deliverables against plan.
  Output: `Must Have [N/N] | Must NOT Have [N/N] | VERDICT: APPROVE/REJECT`

- [ ] F2. Code Quality Review — `unspecified-high`
  Run `npx playwright test --list` + `npm test`. Review all new test files for: proper assertions, evidence capture, timeout handling. Check for hardcoded secrets.
  Output: `Tests [N pass/N fail] | Files [N clean/N issues] | VERDICT`

- [ ] F3. Real Manual QA — `unspecified-high` (+ `playwright` skill if UI)
  Start from clean state. Execute tests: `npm test && npx playwright test`. Verify Playwright screenshots saved. Test cross-feature integration.
  Output: `Tests [N/N pass] | Screenshots [N captured] | VERDICT`

- [ ] F4. Scope Fidelity Check — `deep`
  For each task: read "What to do", read actual test file. Verify 1:1 — all tests in spec were built, nothing beyond spec. Check "Must NOT do" compliance.
  Output: `Tasks [N/N compliant] | VERDICT`
